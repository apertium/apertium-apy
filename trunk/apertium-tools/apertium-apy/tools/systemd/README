To run APY with systemd, edit `apy.service` and change the `User`
field to have the username of the user who should run APY, and
`ExecStart` to how you start APY. Then do

    sudo cp tools/systemd/apy.service /etc/systemd/system/
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload  # Make systemd notice the new apy.service file
	sudo systemctl enable apy     # Make APY start on boot
	sudo systemctl start apy      # Make APY start now

To show the status of the daemon, along with the most recent log
output:

    sudo systemctl status apy

To restart APY:

    sudo systemctl restart apy

To browse the full APY logs:

    sudo journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=apy.service

(You can also browse logs since last boot with `-b` or since yesterday
and so on, see http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/journalctl.html for
some examples.)
