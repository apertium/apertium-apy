                      morph-indux
   A tool for matching lemmas from attested word forms 
   in corpora to Apertium paradigms.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Description:

This is a ghetto version of Markus Forsbergs 'Extract' tool.

It is used for matching lemmas to Apertium paradigms. 

The program first loads the paradigms (and their stems) out of 
a .dix file, then loads a wordlist file into a Trie. It iterates 
through each of the stems in each of the paradigms and retrieves 
candidate lemmas from the Trie. 

After building a list of candidate lemmas, it adds up the number 
of instances found and outputs the list.

For example:

A wordlist file has the following words:

 knjiga, knjigama, knjigo, knjigu, knjizi

And the paradigm for 'knji/ga__n' in the Apertium dictionary has 
the following stems (compressed format for readability):

 [knji/ga__n] (7) [ ga gama ge go gom gu zi ]

The score for the root 'knji' will be 5/7 = 0.71

Usage:

$ ./morph-indux -t <threshold> [dictionary] [wordlist]

Dependencies:

* libxml2

TODO:

* Perhaps a feature to increase the score of matches when stems
  are long... e.g. '-hoero' match scores higher than '-ro' match
  for Tajik.
* Perhaps weight stems with 'more info' (e.g. pl, dom, indef) 
  higher than less, e.g. 'pl'. 
  ~ these two could be related (longer stem = more info?)
  ~ 
* Trie needs fixing -- too much mangling when presented with 
  long lists.
* Add feature to deal with non-lists (e.g. web pages etc.)
* File handling needs to be fixed to allow input from stdin
  ~ e.g. cat /tmp/foo.html | apertium-dehtml | 
         morph-indux -t 0.9 apertium-en-ca.en.dix
* Perhaps have a feature that works on lemmas -- e.g. a list
  of words, and then it generates all the possible forms, then 
  looks for these -- either in a corpus or on the intanet.

DONE:

* Stop it from crapping out when presented with DOS files

--
Issues:

* Contaminated input .. e.g. 'knjigih', 'knjigoj' etc.
