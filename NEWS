* Version 0.9.1, 2016-06-10

  Changes since 0.9.0:

  - Various minor cleanups and lints

  - systemd watchdog – if APY was started by systemd and the .service
    file has e.g. WatchdogSec=10s, we send a watchdog ping every <10s.
    See tools/systemd for example .service file.

  - rewrote missingFreqs-handling to fix locking (in its own class
    now); and don't try to close missingFreqsDb unless it was actually
    open

  - Handle .mode files from newest Apertium (which now quotes paths
    correctly there)

* Version 0.9.0, 2016-02-11
  Git rev: 1d0e110cd1e9a74f0099138823ec31f4c145ea73

  Changes since r61425 / 0dd2cd:

  - First official release with a version number :-)

  - Should now be compatible with all Python versions from 3.2 to
    3.5-dev (raises StopIteration in 3.2, returns from generator in
    higher versions)

  - APY now has some simple regression tests and Continuous
    Integration. See t/README if you want to run them yourself, but
    they are also run at https://travis-ci.org/goavki/apertium-apy on
    every pull request or push to
    https://github.org/goavki/apertium-apy

  - /translateDoc now accepts optional argument &markUnknown which can
    be either "yes" or "no", as /translate already does. Defaults to
    "yes", which will put a "*" in front of any unknown word.

  - New, *experimental* endpoint
    /translatePage?url=URL&langpair=FROM|TO which will retrieve an URL
    and return HTML with translated text. Like /translate, accepts
    optional argument &markUnknown which can be either "yes" or "no",
    and does not block other requests (but if there are few pipelines
    per pair, long page translations may currently hold up shorter
    requests to the same language pair, since we translate the whole
    page in one go instead of splitting it up).

  - New/improved language name localisations (Kyrgyz, Uzbek,
    Qaraqalpaq, Kazakh, Basque, Crimean Tatar, …)

  - More information in /stats: Now shows number of requests, chars
    and time spent actively translating during the last N seconds
    (defaults to 3600, changable with new optional argument -T /
    --stat-period-max-age), and total server uptime.

  - Now does NUL-flushing (keeps pipelines open) even if the pair uses
    hfst-proc or lrx-proc (NUL-flushing works in those programs as of
    2015-10-15).

  - Analysis/generation now both use translateSimple, less duplicate
    code.

  - tools/apertium-viewer.html – a simple one-page HTML interface to
    APY translation, meant for debugging – now does translate as you
    type.

  - tools/sanity-test-apy.py updated to do a healthcheck on all pairs
    currently running on https://apertium.org

  - Minor cleanups suggested by flake8.

* r61425, 2015-08-13
  Git rev: 0dd2cdba544e228b6268f0c0babbdf1698af27f8

  - See http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Apy for an overview of what APY
    can do.
